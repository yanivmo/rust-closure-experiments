Rust + Actix-Web Closure Experiments
====================================

The code in this repository explores the behavior of closures
in various situations, especially when using actix-web library.

Each commit represents a step in the experiment. Commits that
contain correct, executable code have `[ok]` in their description.
Commits marked with `[err]` do not compile.
